# SheepIt Manager

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project is still actively being developed. Don't expect things to work quite yet.

## What it is
This is a manager for [SheepIt](https://sheepit-renderfarm.com). The goal is to help users manage multiple clients easily, all while having a small footprint on the host. This doesn't actually add any extra features to the SheepIt side of things; it's just a wrapper for the .jar.

## Usage
