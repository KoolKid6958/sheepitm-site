## What is it?
This is a manager for [SheepIt](https://sheepit-renderfarm.com). The goal is to help users manage multiple clients easily, all while having a small footprint on the host. This doesn't actually add any extra features to the SheepIt side of things; it's just a wrapper for the .jar.

## Why?
I decided to start working on this project because I have quite a few machines on sheepit, and I wanted a good way to manage them all without really having to do much. I also see this as a good project to learn rust, so it gives me a good goal to work towards.
